# README
## This file describes how the algorithm works and how to use it.

This is a challenge project given by Netvirta (for 2 weeks)

The algorithm is to find the exact contour for a credit card (works generally with any card). The image must be in '.JPG' or '.jpg' format or it would not work. The image must only contain a credit card and background (not very strong texture like lines)

## Location of the file
The final file is in the Phase2 folder under the name Contour_Final_ed.py

## How to use

1. Download the file Contour_Final_ed.py to your computer.
2. Make a folder to place all the images you would like to process.
3. Place Contour_Final.py in the same folder.
4. Go to terminal (Linux) and locate to the folder where you place Contour_Final.py.
5. Type 'python3 Contour_Final.py'
6. The processed images will be renamed with 'Result_' in front of the file name.
